# Sales Forecasting

Online shopping has grown in popularity over the years, mainly because people find it convenient and easy to bargain shop from the comfort of their home or office.

In this project, we will take a look at an online store historical data from 2011 to 2015.


Our goal is to search for insights that can help us to take better decisions in order to consolidate the brand in the market, forecast our sales and improve our grouth rate.

## Development

The development of this project is divided into the following notebooks:

- [Exploratory Data Analysis](source/basic_eda.ipynb)
- [Market Analysis](source/market_analysis.ipynb)
- [Sales Analysis](source/sales_analysis.ipynb)

## Results

Countries that belongs to the champion segmentation account for more than 93% of the sales. Working close to them is important not to lose this lead. Also, countries in the need attention segmentation must be carefully studied, since they spend a good amount of money, but aren’t buying often.

The next month sales is expected to be below the previous month, but seasonality has a big factor in this case.

To improve our sales growth, we can cut the shipping costs by opening closer branches, as well as reduce the amount of discount to increase profit, since it doesn’t have a big impact on sales.
